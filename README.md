# odin-rps
A JavaScript-based project from The Odin Project to apply core JS concepts like loops, conditionals, and functions, while building a simple rock-paper-scissors game for problem-solving practice.

# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

A simple console-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game. While the final version will include a GUI, this is a basic text-based implementation.

### Inputs Required:
- **Number of games**: Prompts the user to input how many times they want to play.
- **Player's choice**: Prompts the user to choose rock, paper, or scissors.

### Game Logic:
1. **Random Choice Generation**: The program generates a random number between 1 and 3 for the computer's choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
2. **Outcome**: The program compares the player's choice with the computer's choice and logs the outcome.
   - If the player wins, they gain a point.
   - If the computer wins, it gains a point.
   - If it's a draw, no points are awarded.

### Pseudo Code:
1. Prompt the player for how many times they want to play.
2. Prompt the player to choose rock, paper, or scissors.
3. Generate a random number between 1 and 3 for the computer to choose rock, paper, or scissors.
4. Log the choices and check the winner (player vs computer).
5. Repeat the game based on the number of rounds.
6. Display the final score and declare the winner.
